During the GNAT task, participants are required to respond
with either "go" or "no go" based on the provided instructions
and within a specified reaction time of 1000 ms [22]. In the
execution of the Go/No-Go Association Task (GNAT),participants need to respond "Go" by pressing the spacebar
when a target word appears and respond "No Go" by not
pressing any key when a distractor word appears
[23].Participants were tasked with completing 22 tasks in the
GNAT, which were divided into two sections: the practice
session and the main session. During the practice session, the
participants were familiarized with the general GNAT
process, beginning with the emergence of stimuli and
instructions on responding to the appropriate stimuli. This
section comprises of six tasks. Upon completion of the
practice section, the session transitions to the main session,
which includes eight main tasks, each initiated by one trial task
[23]. During the test session, participants underwent 16 trials
for the trial task and 60 trials for the main task, as outlined in
TABLE 1.
During the GNAT process, Psychologists from the
Psychology Department at UNISBA observed the behaviour
and body movements of the participants. Subsequently,
psychologists interviewed the participants. There were two
participant criteria specified by psychologists: normal
(represented by "N") and at-risk (represented by "R").
Psychologists determined participant criteria based on
predetermined parameters. In GNAT, the strength of an
association is evaluated by considering the distance of items,
such as words, from the target category. Additionally,
attributes (e.g., traits and objects) not directly related to the
target words may serve as distractors that are not part of the
target words. One condition involves the simultaneous
identification of stimuli representing the target category and
distractors [22], [23].
